# SquadKnowHow

URL: https://squadknowhow.herokuapp.com/ (give it a little time until the Heroku dynos spin up)

The Website was used for information technology competition in Bulgaria and because of that the platform was initially craeted fully in Bulgarian. Some efforts were made to translate it to English, but because of lack of time only half of it was translated, simply due to the sheer amount of text.

SquadKnowHow is a web application made with Spring MVC and MySQL with Hibernate and it is a platform that eases the whole process of finding a team to collaborate with and realise your project or idea. The platform is able to create, manage, brainstorm and finally realise the project with a user friendly interface and many more features. It is also aimed at people who are looking to freelance in a certain project and have certain skills, abilities and interests. The website has a lot more features than what meets the eye such as:

- [Specialized roles](#specialized-roles)
- [CV creation](#cv-creation)
- [Communication system](#communication-system)
- [Filtering](#filtering)
- [Automatic telephone calls](#telephone-calls)
- [Funding](#funding)
- [Automatic search for possible collaborators](#automation)

## Specialized roles

- In this platform before people are able to register they must choose in which role they specialize in. After they have decided for a specialty in SquadKnowHow their experience will be tailored for the needs and nature of their respective profession and they will be able to distinguish themselves extremely easy from the other users in the website.

## CV creation

- When the users have already decided with which profession they will create their profile they are walked through the process of creating an account. There they are able to make a compact CV of themselves in order to increase the chances of someone finding them and also to ease people who are looking for specific things in a person. In this CV a user can include his image, skills, interests, education, working place, working places in the past, languages, project links (or github links). Name, email, password and description are mandatory while the other information is optional. After they are done with this whole process the system will send them an email in order to authenticate them and grant them access to SquadKnowHow.

## Communication system

- SquadKnowHow provides the users with a fully-fledged messaging system that works in a similar way as electronic messages. People can access their messages in the page "Моите съобщения". Everytime when something that concerns a certain user happens this user gets a notification. In order to make the communication between two possible business partners as easy as possible SquadKnowHow provides users with video and voice-only calls (as Skype or Discord). It works on top of the Web technology developed by Google WebRTC.

## Filtering

- People, Project and Auctions in the system can be filter in various ways. People can be filtered by their name, profession, skills, city, interests and can be ordered by rating, date of creation and number of recommendations. Projects can be filtered by name, profession that they seek and city they are located in, also, but in addition they can be filtered by maps. That means that a person can write an address and select a radius and only those projects, which are in this radius will be selected;

## Funding

- When a user clicks on a certain project, he is redirected to the corresponding project page. In this project page every single information that is related to this project is displayed. That means that here the pictures of the project, how many percent of the funding is gathered, information about the idea as a whole, every update, comments on the project, list of type of users that the project needs and some utility buttons are shown. A user can fund a certain project if they decide to. The funding is realized through PayPal and naturally people must have their own PayPal account (PayPal is still in sandbox account!!!). After the payment is done correctly, is legal and is above 100$ the creator of the project is notified through an automated phone call that plays an audio file and notifies the creator of the payment. The automated phone calls are made with Twillio.

## Automatic search for possible collaborators

- One very important tool in the system is the chatbot, which is located in the bottom-right corner of almost every single page. People can talk to it and it will respond as best as it can, but it's main purpose is to recommend possible collaborators taking into consideration all of the specifications of the creator of the project that he has given, when he has created the project. It is 100% accurate. The chatbot is made with the service of SAP Conversational API.

## Auctions

- In order SquadKnowHow to be the perfect place for every entrepreneur, it needed to be able to even create auctions for the projects that are similar to the auctions in eBay.

---

## Voice recognition

- The system is able to provide support for people with physical disabilities. With voice command people can navigate through pages, filter entries, get help and perform a lot of different activities in the platform.

---

## Tests (Optional)

- The business logic in the services of this project is 95%-96% covered by unit tests ensuring the flawless performance of the code.
